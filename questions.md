Sure! Here are some JavaScript practice questions that you can use to prepare for a JavaScript interview:

1. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string.

2. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.

3. Write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the larger of the two numbers.

4. Write a function that takes an array of strings as input and returns a new array with only the strings that have a length greater than 5.

5. Write a function that takes a number as input and returns true if the number is prime, and false otherwise.

6. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels in that string.

7. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the largest number in the array.

8. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns true if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and false otherwise.

9. Write a function that takes two arrays as input and returns a new array that contains only the elements that are present in both arrays.

10. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array with the numbers sorted in ascending order.

Remember to test your code with different inputs to ensure it works correctly. Good luck with your interview preparation!
