Sure! Here's a test that measures the skills you mentioned for a mid-entry full stack developer intern. This test consists of 30 questions that cover various areas, including numerical analysis, understanding pseudocode, interpreting patterns, performing calculations, paying attention to details, and problem solving. The questions are programming language agnostic, allowing candidates to focus on the underlying concepts rather than specific syntax.

Please note that the answers to these questions may vary, and this test is meant to assess a candidate's understanding and problem-solving skills. It's recommended to provide clear instructions and indicate any specific assumptions or requirements for each question.

1. Numerical Analysis:
   a) Calculate the square root of 144.
   b) Convert the decimal number 0.75 to a fraction in simplest form.

2. Understanding Pseudocode:
   Write a pseudocode algorithm to find the sum of all elements in an array.

3. Interpreting Patterns:
   Identify the pattern and complete the sequence:
   2, 4, 8, 16, __.

4. Performing Calculations:
   Calculate the result of `(6 * 2) + (8 / 4)`.

5. Paying Attention to Details:
   Identify any syntax errors or issues in the following code snippet:
   ```javascript
   for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++ {
     console.log(i);
   }
   ```

6. Problem Solving:
   Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the highest value in the array.

7. Numerical Analysis:

8. Understanding Pseudocode:
   Write a pseudocode algorithm to determine if a given number is a prime number.

9. Interpreting Patterns:
   Identify the pattern and complete the sequence:
   1, 4, 9, 16, __.

10. Performing Calculations:
    Calculate the result of `2^5` (2 raised to the power of 5).

11. Paying Attention to Details:
    Identify any logical errors or issues in the following code snippet:
    ```javascript
    function sumNumbers(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }
    
    console.log(sumNumbers(2, 3));
    ```

12. Problem Solving:
    Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels in the string.

13. Numerical Analysis:
    Calculate the absolute value of -8.

14. Understanding Pseudocode:
    Write a pseudocode algorithm to swap the values of two variables.

15. Interpreting Patterns:

    1, 1, 2, 3, 5, __.

16. Performing Calculations:
    Calculate the result of `(10 + 5) * 2 - 3`.

17. Paying Attention to Details:
    Identify any syntax errors or issues in the following code snippet:
    ```python
    def multiply_numbers(a, b):
      return a * b
    
    result = multiply_numbers(3, 4)
    print(result
    ```

18. Problem Solving:
